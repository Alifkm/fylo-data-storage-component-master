## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SASS
- Flexbox
- Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In this challenge I learned how to use Grid. I also used Flexbox to some items. I think Mobile-first workflow is better than desktop-first workflow because for me it's easier to maintain the code. 

### Useful resources

- [Learn Grid from Wes Bos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-slCsOrLcc&list=PLu8EoSxDXHP5CIFvt9-ze3IngcdAc2xKG) - This helped me to learn how to use Grid easily. have fun learning:)
